# Quick Combat module for FVTT
Adds the ability to add a Combat Playlist. Whenever you start combat the playlist will start.
 * Added Macro Support to Add Tokens to Combat, Start and Stop Combat.
 * Added more settings to NOT roll any initiative for any token. This will enable to mod to just start/stop playlists.
 * You can now define any number of playlists Combat/Boss/Mini Boss whatever fits your needs. Works best with the `Choose Playlist Settings`. You can even define playlists for specific scenes!

Adds Auto Experience Tracking. When NPCs are defeated it will add the experience to PCs.

Adds a Hotkey to quickly add PCs, and NPCs to the combat tracker, roll their initiatives, and start combat.

Includes a compendium of character features to exclude actors from combat.
